# Education

**2013.11 -- 2017.08**:	PhD in Computer Science.
Double supervision program between France ([University of Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/)) and Ukraine ([National Technical University of Ukraine 
“Igor Sikorsky KPI”](https://kpi.ua/en/)). Studies financed by French and Ukrainian government scholarships.
Supervisors: [Oleg Chertov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleg-chertov-50583a19/) from NTUU “Igor Sikorsky KPI”, [Armelle Brun](https://members.loria.fr/ABrun/) and 
[Anne Boyer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anne-Boyer-2) from the University of Lorraine.
Check my thesis online ["Matrix Factorization and Contrast Analysis Technics for Recommendation"](http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2017_0080_ALEKSANDROVA.pdf).

**2015.08 -- 2015.10**: Secondment at the [Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM)](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/institute/about), Linz, Austria.
This secondment was a part of the
Joint European Project “Approximation Methods for Molecular Modelling and Diagnosis Tools” (“AMMODIT”).
During this internship, I worked on the approach that proposes a solution for a prediction task based on the aggregation of already known predictors.
The procedure used for the aggregation ensures that the resulting aggregator performs at least as good as the best of already known predictors.
This work resulted in a publication 
[*Prediction of nocturnal hypoglycemia by an aggregation of previously known prediction approaches: proof of concept for clinical application*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016926071630164X).


**2011.09 -- 2013.06**: 	Master of Applied Mathematics (degree with distinction) from the [National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky KPI”](https://kpi.ua/en/), 
Applied Mathematics Department.

**2007.09 -- 2011.06**: Bachelor of Applied Mathematics (degree  with distinction) from the [National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky KPI”](https://kpi.ua/en/), 
Applied Mathematics Department.
