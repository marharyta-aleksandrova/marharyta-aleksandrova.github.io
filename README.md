# About me

Hi there!

I am a researcher in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/) 
where I am a member of [SECAN-Lab](https://secan-lab.uni.lu/) team.

Feel free to browse this website to learn about my [research](research.md), [teaching](teaching.md), and other experiences. You can also find out more by checking my 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marharyta-aleksandrova-8b567245/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rwcqydIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) pages.
